<h1>You are Not alone</h1>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>This got its inspiration from Liverpool's motto. <em>"You are not alone"</em>.
we intend to create a community where people are free from stigmatisation and where they can get a safe space especially when one feels like no one is there or nobody understands. We hope to bring on board organizations and professional psychologists who can offer help when much beeded </p>
